# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

This is a very primitive instructions that I have tested on my MacBook using zshrc shell.

1. Clone this git repo
2. Open the file '~/.zshrc' using nano of vim.
3. Append to the end of the file the following (where you edit the contents with the location of the dcmfind.py script from the repo from step 1)

```

### My own stuff ###

# dicom-utilities git repo
alias dcmfind='python3 /Users/olegunnar/Documents/Jobb/NIL/dev/dicom-utilities/dcmfind/dcmfind.py'

```
